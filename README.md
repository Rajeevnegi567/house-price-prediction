House Price Prediction – End-to-End Regression Modeling Project :

This project builds an end-to-end regression modeling workflow to predict house prices using historical real-estate data from India.
It demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a data science project—from exploratory analysis to model deployment and evaluation.

Project Overview

Real estate prices depend on multiple factors such as living area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, condition, location, year built, renovation, and more.
The goal of this project is to build an accurate and interpretable machine learning model that predicts house prices using these features.

This workflow follows industry standards with:

Baseline models

Regression techniques

Regularization

Cross-validation

Multicollinearity checks

Final “Champion Model” selection

Exporting final artifacts

Final Champion Model

After comparing all models based on CV scores + test metrics:

✔ The best-performing model (“Champion Model”) was saved as:
Model/champion_model.joblib

✔ The test predictions were saved as:
Output/houseprice_predictions_test.csv

✔ Test set metrics were stored in:
Output/test_metrics.jso
